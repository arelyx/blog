_A short response to the prompt: Write about something you love._

Get a load of this. The computer science kid likes computers. But what can I say? It's true.

Everyone has that one interest that seems to awaken something within them, and for me it's computers. Ever since a young age I've been fascinated by these machines. Compared to all my other worldly possessions at the time—some clay, a couple dozen wooden blocks, a few Hot Wheels—the family computer was a fantastical device that seemed to break Newtonian physics. How could I not be intrigued?

Since then, my interest in computing can best be described as a continuous journey of understanding how these mysterious boxes worked. From basic PC parts to low level components. To software and the various systems and protocols that run our modern world. It's been an incredibly rewarding experience, one where with each new concept I learn, another five questions breach the horizon.
