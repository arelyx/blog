I want to work in tech.  
What does it mean to work in tech?  
I work with computers. I do computing.  

Overwhelming feeling I’m not going to make it.  
So much competition. So many people.  
The sheer volume of people vying for the same position is incomprehensible to me.  
The number of intelligent people is astounding.  
How can I possibly compare?  

I just want to live an upper middle class life.  
I just want a house, health insurance, and a car.  

Six figures. Sounds like a lot.  
But now it feels like the minimum for the American dream.  
Income distribution  is skewed to the right.  
[This shows who the “elite” are in the US.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Distribution_of_Annual_Household_Income_in_the_United_States_2010.png)  
Even if the outliers were removed. Would that really make it fair?  

I detest college prestige.  
It’s impossible for high schoolers to do anything. The system almost actively tries to snuff out any passion or drive.  
Only way for under 18s to achieve anything is through parental support.  
How the hell are college admissions supposed to gauge potential from that?  

At the end of the day we all have to learn calc 3. Is it really much of a difference between institutions?  

What makes me intensely sad isn’t that I can’t get “prestige”.  
I detest prestige. But with prestige comes resources.  
I hate the feeling that I can’t do as much as I could’ve.  
Being told I didn't do as much as I could've.

(But don't get it twisted.  
I love this school.  
I wouldn't trade it for anything.)
